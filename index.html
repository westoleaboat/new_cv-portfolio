              <p class="tabs__textarea__description">
                Data analysis is the main reason why I learnt Python. My working experience taught me that
                you can
                have lots of data, but knowing how to extract information is a different thing! This is a
                script in
                where a <b>random Pandas DataFrame</b> is created and plotted using <b>matplotlib</b>. A new
                set of
                values is created every second and the plot is updated automatically (after you press the
                button).
                The main goal in here was to <b>plot</b> the DataFrame graph <b>inside</b> the <b>Tkinter
                  GUI</b>
                with the <b>FigureCanvasTkAgg module</b> from <b>matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg</b>, as
                to have
                an executable program that allows you to work and generate plots, further than just showing
                a graph
                with the <i>plt.show()</i> function.

                This application launches a transparent, maximized window that captures mouse click coordinates using the <b>Mouse package</b>, then utilizes <b>PIL's ImageGrab</b> to generate an image. The user is presented with an elegant GUI to scan the generated image, with <b>OpenCV</b> detecting QR codes and displaying the decoded data. An 'image-file.png' is generated, and users may require elevated privileges to run the app. Simply click the top-left and bottom-right corners of the QR code you wish to scan after executing the program.

                will need
                an existing QR code to scan before executing the script. Once you run the app click the

                Databases are an excelent way of storing information, and should not be annoying to deal

                project also came as a result of the paperwork created while managing a warehouse
                <b>inventory</b>.
                When launching the app for the first time a database with a profile table is created using
                the
                <b>sqlite3 package</b>. The app is managed through a GUI which displays real time data, you
                can
                Delete and Add new elements as you wish, while Editing a record will open a new window
                allowing you
                to modify the database record.
