I am an Environmental Engineer who started programming for data analysis on my bachelor thesis, and later developed to other branches as a way to improve my engineering skills. On my free time I deal with Linux Distros, technology research and try to run my own servers. I am currently focused on web development, specifically through HubSpot CMR.
